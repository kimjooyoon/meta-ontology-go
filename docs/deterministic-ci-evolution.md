# Deterministic CI Evolution Retrospective

Status: append-only, read-only retrospective evidence. This document does not
activate, adopt, or block any metric; change CI; reopen a product decision; or
claim that a prototype package, observer, verifier, LSP, or analyzer exists on
`dev`.

- source-task final packet read: `01a0033a-6e20-7ef0-9161-93e48dae3d08`

The source snapshot separates business authority, normalized meaning, code
projection, observations, provenance, and policy. This entry records that
snapshot; it does not promote the design contracts described below.

### Durable foundations

The following are current repository contracts or implementation-backed
boundaries, not claims that every future observer exists:

- `.gooo` declarations own business intent; stable semantic IDs own identity;
  semantic IR is normalized meaning; generated Go is structural projection;
  handwritten slots own irreducible logic.
- Go observations are classified as syntactic, candidate, or deterministic.
  Only accepted, deterministic, source-backed facts may change semantic state.
  Partial observation is not deletion, and conflicting reconciliation is
  transactional.
- The BX laws are Get-Put, Put-Get, semantic round-trip, locality, and
  provenance. Presentation may normalize; it may not change stable IDs or
  unrelated semantic facts.
- Generated regions have stable markers and handwritten slots. Provenance and
  verification records are append-only evidence, not a write-back channel.
- The compact PROV-inspired core derives only the declared activity-input
  `used` and activity-result `wasGeneratedBy` relations. Domain relations are
  not inferred from ordinary names or helper calls.
- Current CI and promotion are fail-closed and CI-only. The six canonical proof
  jobs, route-specific Guardian context, exact ref/topology evidence, and
  promotion authorization are current governance contracts; richer metric
  observers and self-hosted promotion are not.

### Retrospective: repeated speculative work

The repository history shows repeated refinement of metric vocabulary, closed
failure states, resource/semantic profiles, pressure selection, epochs, finite
path proof, typed paths, and code-semantic receipts. That work produced useful
contracts and boundaries, but it did not produce `EXACT_BOUND` adoption:

- `docs/metrics-rfc.md` remains design-only and defines no evaluator, verifier,
  workflow, merge rule, or blocking check.
- `docs/metric-catalog.md` remains a design-only catalog. Its observability
  labels (`NOW`, `PARTIAL`, `MISSING`) are not adoption state.
- `docs/floor-ceiling-epochs.md` remains a future architecture contract. Its
  selector, scheduler, epoch, proof, and phase bindings are not current CI
  entry points.
- `docs/code-semantic-coupling.md` defines two inactive contracts. They have no
  catalog rows, adopted observer, stable CLI, LSP API, or blocking effect.
- Bootstrap and future host material remain non-promoting evidence shapes;
  deferred, not-run, and candidate results are not success.

The retrospective conclusion is therefore specific: repeated speculative
research can improve the design vocabulary without becoming an accepted
measurement. The durable kernel should be retained; unregistered metric and
research surfaces should not be treated as evidence of implementation.

### Exact current count rule

The current denominator is defined mechanically from the current catalog:

```text
active_catalog_rows = current MetricID rows in docs/metric-catalog.md
                    = 54
adopted_rows        = rows whose adoption column is not UNOBSERVED
                    = 0
```

All 54 active catalog rows are `UNOBSERVED`. Count rows, not prose mentions,
observability labels, historical digests, conversations, or hypotheses. The
historical `gooo.metric.design.intent-cardinality.v1` definition is excluded
from the active denominator; `v2` is the current catalog row and the v1 text
remains historical only. The 171 conversation hypotheses are frozen research
hypotheses, not catalog rows, observations, metrics, or gates.

### Analytical exposure model (not empirical evidence)

An unregistered inference surface is any natural-language, agent, runtime, or
other decision point that can select semantic meaning, scope, applicability,
provider, path, or resource treatment without a registered deterministic
contract and bound evidence. Let `U_t` be the surfaces exposed in an hour and
let `p_i` be an unknown per-surface probability of an unobserved semantic
exposure. Under the explicitly analytical independent-surface approximation:

```text
Exposure(U_t) = 1 - product(i in U_t, (1 - p_i))
Exposure(U_t + j) - Exposure(U_t) = p_j * product(i in U_t, (1 - p_i)) > 0
```

The second expression shows the monotonic direction: holding the assumptions
and a nonzero `p_j` fixed, adding an unregistered surface increases the chance
that at least one semantic decision is outside deterministic evidence. No
`p_i`, event rate, or exposure value is measured here. Correlation, changing
workload, and surface equivalence are UNKNOWN; they must not be estimated into
a gate. If the assumptions cannot be bound, the result is `UNKNOWN`, not a
comforting zero.

### Monotonic target: zero runtime semantic inference

The target is a contract, not a current measurement:

```text
runtime_semantic_inference_surfaces(next) <= runtime_semantic_inference_surfaces(current)
target = 0
```

Runtime may observe declared effects, outputs, host behavior, latency, and
resources when a runtime profile exists. It must not infer or mutate business
meaning, semantic identity, scope, or provenance authority at runtime. Semantic
binding, path selection, and domain meaning must be resolved before runtime;
missing or ambiguous resolution is `UNKNOWN`/fail-closed. Zero runtime semantic
inference does not mean zero runtime observation.

## Exact machine boundaries

These are closed design boundaries recorded for future registered evaluators;
they are not claims that the corresponding packages or APIs exist today.

### Impact graph

- Roots are registry-resolved changed semantic surfaces and their stable
  semantic owners; a rename includes both previous and new registered paths.
- The graph is built from immutable snapshot-bound stable IDs, source-map
  bindings, canonical authoritative relations, and declared dependency/
  obligation edges. `G_exec` contains only adapter-root → bound semantic ID and
  caller semantic ID → resolved callee semantic ID for canonical authoritative
  calls.
- Closure is reachability from the declared roots over those edges, sorted by
  stable ID. Changed files, names, aliases, candidate facts, inverse/derived
  views, unresolved symbols, reflection/string names, unreachable code, and
  test-only edges unless policy includes tests are outside the graph.
- A missing or ambiguous root, owner, adapter, call, source origin, ID, or
  reachability result is `UNKNOWN`, never an empty impact set.

### Work frontier

- Protected policy supplies `N`, `M`, and `requested_K`; illustrative counts are
  not language constants. All baseline/floor guards are reserved first.
- `PressureSelection` binds the snapshot, policy/catalog/dependency digests,
  baseline/candidate/selected/unselected/unknown sets, rank inputs, shortfall,
  attempts, next-path IDs, and work-receipt digests. Missing rank inputs are
  `UNKNOWN`, not zero or agent preference.
- Tasks declare phase, dependencies, semantic read/write closure, provider and
  evaluator, lease requirements, resource claims, and retained cost. Ready
  tasks are sorted by phase, pressure rank, criticality, retained work, and
  stable task ID; scheduling returns a maximal compatible set.
- The next-path frontier is the set of declared, untried continuations. A path
  is `EXHAUSTED` only with a retained terminal result and no declared
  continuation. Workers cannot choose pressures, invent paths, close
  obligations, write proof, or self-approve.

### Resource envelope

The minimum shared envelope is:

```text
FixtureEnvelope {
  source_digest, semantic_input_digest, oracle_digest,
  obligation_partition, output_digest, work_receipt_digest,
  toolchain/options_digest
}
```

Resource claims bind deterministic work units, memory/artifact limits, fixture,
options, toolchain, provider, and receipt digest. Wall-clock time is shadow
evidence unless the environment is pinned; it cannot compensate for an
authority, semantic, or provenance failure. For cataloged source resources,
`ResourcePathSet(snapshot)` is selected by immutable path policy, each path
resolves to exactly one blob, canonical formatting/LF normalization is used,
and physical/function LOC ambiguity is `UNKNOWN`. Resource caps remain
resource checks, not semantic DAMP/DRY evidence.

### Semantic binding

One registered code surface binds exactly one stable semantic owner through a
source-map binding digest. For one snapshot, receipts are exactly the
registry-resolved changed surfaces, with one current receipt per surface.
`DELTA` requires a non-empty canonical before/after IR delta, typed
source-backed accepted facts, and an updated authoritative source digest.
`NO_DELTA` requires equal canonical semantic digests under the same registry,
toolchain, and profile digests. Canonical semantic digests include stable IDs,
typed relations, authority status, and normalization profile; labels, spans,
aliases, and permitted ordering are excluded. Candidate-only observations do
not update authority. Missing, stale, duplicate, unregistered, or ambiguous
binding is `UNKNOWN`/fail-closed, never inferred `NO_DELTA`.

### PROV closure

PROV is the provenance SSOT, not business-intent SSOT. The allowed initial
vocabulary is `Entity`, `Activity`, `Agent`, `used`, `wasGeneratedBy`,
`wasDerivedFrom`, and `wasAssociatedWith`; applying it to this repository is a
repository contract, not an open-world proof.

The finite proof boundary is:

```text
G_obligation = declared obligations + typed dependencies
G_path       = providers + phase edges + alternative paths
required     = obligations reachable from declared epoch roots
covered      = obligations with valid source/snapshot-bound path witnesses
complete     = covered == required
             AND every reachable alternative is witnessed or exhausted
             AND every edge has a registered provider/evaluator
             AND graph digest == epoch graph digest
```

Nodes and edges are sorted by stable ID. Duplicate, ambiguous, unbound,
scope-crossing, or digest-mismatched edges fail. An unbounded cycle, missing
provider/evaluator/binding/input, or unavailable graph is `UNKNOWN`. Completion
proves coverage/exhaustion only relative to this finite declared graph; it does
not prove open-world completeness, termination, semantic equivalence, or that
an omitted implementation does not exist.

## UNKNOWN and full-suite fallback

`UNKNOWN` is the required result for missing, ambiguous, stale, mismatched, or
unregistered authority, registry, source-map, provider, evaluator, oracle,
graph, lease, resource, or receipt inputs. `DEFERRED` and `NOT_RUN` never mean
`PASS`; `NOT_APPLICABLE` requires same-snapshot immutable catalog proof. There
is no “when inputs exist” escape.

If a selected subset or frontier cannot be justified, record the deterministic
selection shortfall and do not authorize as though selection succeeded. A
future registered evaluator may fall back to the full declared baseline and
obligation vector, with fresh snapshot-bound evidence; if that full evaluator
is not registered or runnable, the result remains `UNKNOWN` and no authority
path is promoted. This is not a change to current CI and is not a claim that a
new full-suite package exists. Existing repository checks prove only their
documented commands.

## Non-reopening NO-GO decisions

The following decisions remain closed for this retrospective:

- Do not activate/adopt catalog rows, `EXACT_BOUND`, `SHADOW`, `BLOCKING`,
  epoch promotion, or a new CI gate from prose, research, or a successful job.
- Do not treat hypotheses, candidate facts, missing/deferred/not-run results,
  unselected work, or producer claims as `PASS`; do not use weighted masking,
  score compensation, or automatic adoption.
- Do not use an LLM or agent to choose priority, paths, providers, scope, or
  semantic authority; do not let a worker self-approve or write the judge.
- Do not claim theorem proving, PCC, open-world graph completeness, hermetic
  execution, or a replacement for Bazel, DSSE, in-toto, or SLSA.
- Do not infer business relations from ordinary names, helper calls, runtime
  behavior, or natural-language similarity. Do not turn candidate observations
  into authority without an explicit source-backed delta.
- Do not claim self-hosting, a gooo-hosted verifier, stable `analyze`/`lsp`,
  durable provenance publishing, or new prototype packages on `dev` without an
  implemented entry point and runnable evidence.

## Canonical evidence index

The following sources are the canonical index for this entry:

- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): authority boundaries, roles, required checks, and
  current CI-only branch contract.
- [Architecture](architecture.md): SSOT matrix, current package boundaries,
  PROV-inspired lowering, and unsupported future surfaces.
- [Governance](governance.md): BX laws, provenance policy, generated boundaries,
  and current CI/promotion evidence rules.
- [Metrics RFC](metrics-rfc.md): closed metric states, adoption state machine,
  resource definitions, UNKNOWN rules, and catalog immutability.
- [Metric catalog](metric-catalog.md): the 54-row current denominator, all
  `UNOBSERVED`, and the historical v1 exclusion.
- [Floor/Ceiling Epochs](floor-ceiling-epochs.md): design-only selection,
  frontier, finite proof, resource envelope, and future phase placement.
- [Code-Semantic Coupling](code-semantic-coupling.md): registered surfaces,
  semantic binding, typed paths, receipts, and inactive metric contracts.
- [Bootstrap evidence](bootstrap-evidence.md): non-promoting baseline/candidate
  envelopes and deferred/not-run semantics.
- [Language specification](spec.md): supported semantic boundary, PROV core,
  fact statuses, and unsupported/deferred feature policy.
- Repository history for these contracts, including `34547e0`, `7c0950e`,
  `cfc0116`, and `de9b45a`, is evidence of repeated design refinement, not
  evidence of metric adoption.
- The source-task final packet named in the authority snapshot corroborates the
  durable-kernel/design-only distinction and the frozen `171` hypotheses; it is
  a read-only handoff, not a repository authority view.

Future retrospective evidence must append a new dated entry with its own
authority snapshot and digest. It must not rewrite this entry's count,
conclusions, or evidence references.
